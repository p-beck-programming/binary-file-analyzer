Binary Analysis Tool

Hello, this is my first binary analysis tool and I learned a lot throughout the process. 
To use the tool, I suggest setting up a virtual enviroment, making sure to install the dependecies in the requirements.txt file.

This binary-file-analyzer is a tool designed to inspect and analyze binary files for various characteristics and potential issues. It can be used to extract metadata, identify file types, and detect anomalies within binary files. 

For example, one use case is analyzing a suspicious executable file to determine if it contains any hidden or malicious code. By running the tool, you can extract information about the file's structure, check for known signatures of malware, and gain insights into its behavior without executing it. This helps in assessing the file's safety and understanding its purpose before deciding on further actions.
